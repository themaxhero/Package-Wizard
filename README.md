# Package Wizard

## Introduction
Package Wizard is a project made thinking about all the times I've tried to order something but all the shipping companies where unknown or I had some problem with them.

My goal with package wizard is to provide a common api between shops and shipping companies to give the customer the real choice of who should carry their packages.

## Running Locally

To start the project:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
